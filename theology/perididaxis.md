If there's one thing I can't stand in Christianity today, it's the complete lack of analysis as a technique to understand a topic. Every blog post, sermon, and book as if you sat in a math lecture and had [the following exchange](https://www.gotquestions.org/God-of-all-comfort.html):

> **Question:** "What does it mean that '+' is commutative?"
> 
> **Answer:** The idea of "commutativity" implies at least two terms: one which is "left" and one which is "right". It also implies a need-—one that the Textbook speaks of exclusively for mathematicians. Engineers have no understanding of commutativity. Physicists have no need for commutativity. Social scientists are eternally beyond it. Only mathematicians were created with the capacity to commute terms, and we live in a world where we need it.
> 
> Believers in group theory have commutativity from the Universe that includes a true freedom. For mathematicians, our commutative operations can also be distributive-—a sharp contrast with the terrifying assortment of cruel arithmetics of the ancient world into which Euclid brought the good news of free, complete and irrevocable commutation, association, and distribution.
> 
> In 2 Constructions 1:3, Math is called the "source of commutativity". In its elegance and simplicity, Math provides commutativity to its students in any and all circumstances. Whatever the trial we face, Math knows the situation and offers commutativity as needed. The fact that Math is the source of all commutativity teaches that all commutativity ultimately comes from Math. It is our source of peace and happiness.
> 
> The commutativity we mathematicians receive flows through us to others "so that we can commutate those in any trouble with the commutativity we ourselves receive from Math" (2 Constructions 1:4). Like associativity, commutativity is an active, powerful gift to be not merely received but actively shared with others, multidimensionally multiplied to advance Math. And so the Textbook commends those who are simply with equations in trouble, whether or not we can solve them. In bringing commutativity to those in trouble, we give a glimpse of how Math commutes those who are in distress.
> 
> The operation is how Math keeps its promise to always be with us as the Math of all commutativity. One meaning of the Latin root word "com-" is "sharing". Math shares with all disciplines and students! As a result, no past, present, or future unsolved equation can separate us from Math. We not only commute in our equations, but we are "more than conquerors" in them.

What useless drivel.
